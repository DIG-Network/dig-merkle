//! # dig-merkle — the DIG Network canonical CHIP-0035 DataLayer coin expert crate
//!
//! `dig-merkle` is a **pure, key-free, network-free** SpendBundle-builder for the Chia CHIP-0035
//! DataLayer singleton that anchors a `.dig` file's merkle root on-chain. It constructs the exact
//! [`CoinSpend`]s for every DataLayer-coin lifecycle operation and reports — via
//! [`required_signatures`] — the exact signatures a caller must produce. It never holds a secret
//! key, never signs, and never touches the network. The consumer signs the reported messages,
//! assembles the `SpendBundle`, and broadcasts.
//!
//! ## The DataLayer coin
//!
//! A DataLayer coin is a CHIP-0035 singleton whose `launcher_id` IS the DIG `store_id`. Its
//! [`DataStoreMetadata`] carries the capsule's `root_hash` (the anchored `.dig` merkle root) plus
//! optional `label`/`description`/`bytes`/`size_proof`, and its [`DelegatedPuzzle`] list grants
//! admin/writer/oracle authority. Spending the coin recreates it with a new root, transferring
//! ownership, delegating write access, or melting it. dig-merkle builds each such spend unsigned.
//!
//! ## Invariants
//!
//! These four invariants hold across the entire crate and are the contract every unit is built to
//! (SPEC §1):
//!
//! - **INV-1 — No network.** dig-merkle performs NO network or chain I/O. Every function is a pure
//!   transform of its inputs; the caller fetches coins and broadcasts bundles.
//! - **INV-2 — No keys.** dig-merkle never accepts, holds, derives, or logs a secret key. It
//!   computes what must be signed ([`required_signatures`]); the caller's signer produces the
//!   signatures.
//! - **INV-3 — Unsigned output.** Every operation returns an unsigned [`MerkleCoinSpend`] — coin
//!   spends plus the recreated child DataStore. Signatures are always the caller's responsibility.
//! - **INV-4 — SDK byte-source-of-truth.** Every puzzle, layer, and coin-spend byte is produced by
//!   `chia-wallet-sdk` (pinned to the 0.30 / chia-protocol 0.26 family, `chip-0035` feature).
//!   dig-merkle adds DataLayer-workflow ergonomics on top; it never re-implements a puzzle or
//!   hand-rolls a spend bundle, and re-exports the SDK's DataStore types verbatim.
//!
//! ## Consumer pattern
//!
//! ```text
//! build an unsigned MerkleCoinSpend  ->  required_signatures(&spend.coin_spends, &constants)
//!   ->  caller signs each reported message  ->  assemble SpendBundle  ->  broadcast
//! ```
//!
//! ## Status
//!
//! U1 ships the foundation: the type surface ([`MerkleCoinSpend`], [`Owner`], and the re-exported
//! SDK DataStore types), the error taxonomy ([`MerkleError`]), the inner-spend helpers, and the
//! signing boundary ([`required_signatures`]). The DataLayer operations land in their own units
//! against this foundation; their modules are declared below as doc-only stubs so the layout is
//! final.
//!
//! The planned operation surface (each a future unit):
//! - `mint` — launch a new DataLayer coin anchoring a root (`mint_root_from_launcher` takes a
//!   parent coin id, so a DID-authorized launcher composes without a dig-did dependency).
//! - `update` — recreate the coin with a new merkle root (an owner or writer update).
//! - `delegation` — grant/revoke admin/writer/oracle [`DelegatedPuzzle`] authority.
//! - `oracle` — spend the oracle delegated puzzle to read the coin for a fee.
//! - `melt` — terminally spend the coin, leaving no successor.
//! - `read` — parse the current on-chain state (no spend).
//! - `hydrate` — reconstruct a spendable [`DataStore`] from a parent coin spend (fail-closed).
//! - `lineage` — derive the [`LineageProof`] a child spend requires.
//! - `hint` — the owner/delegation hint memo domain (`b"dig:datastore:owner:v1"`).
//! - `fee` — attach a reserve fee condition to any operation.

// Internal helpers — not part of the public surface.
